<p>Hello, this is my first post ever. It is simply about how it was built.</p>
<p>First of all, all credits goes to <a href="https://github.com/utdemir">Utku Demir</a>, because I mostly copied <a href="http://utdemir.com/posts/hakyll-on-nixos.html">his setup</a>. I simply removed font-awesome and Disqus in order to make it work, I also used a different style (from the <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">same theme repository</a>).</p>
<p>It was built with the aid of <a href="http://nixos.org/nix/">nix</a> and <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">hakyll</a>. This is also my first attemps at haskell, looks good to me :D.</p>
<p>Another choice that I made differently is that I keep the sources of the static pages in the same repository as the static pages. It save me a little bit of (unecessary) git-foo.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>I wanted something minimal, but using nix. [Utmedir]’s way seemed nice, so I tried it and liked it. So I will stick with that for the moment.</p>
<h2 id="pros">Pros</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deterministic builds!</li>
<li>I can work on a post without publishing it, as long as I don’t re-compile <em>and</em> re-commit/push the changes. This is really a fundamental feature for blogging, but I wasn’t sure how it would work if I used something that minimal.</li>
<li>I can write post in every format supported by <a href="http://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>.</li>
<li>I can customize the build at will. Of course, I could do that with a project written by some scaffolding tool like yeoman. But here, I didn’t have to learn anything special. Hell, I never touched haskell code, but I had no difficulty modifying the DSL Hakyll uses.</li>
<li>I can write posts in <em>any</em> editor (currently using vim in a terminal). Also, I didn’t check, but I am sure there are some editor with live preview (maybe Atom?).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cons">Cons</h2>
<ul>
<li>No minification out of the box.</li>
<li>No as interactive as I like, at my job I maintain a whole application written in common lisp, it is highly satisfying to re-evaluate a small piece of code in emacs and see the result in the browser almost immediatly. With this setup, I need to call something at the command line to rebuild the whole thing. I am pretty sure I can fix those issues with some file watchers and some live-reload.</li>
<li>It doesn’t use boring technology. It might be harder to find help/documentation/etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spell checker - I know myself, I will need it :P</li>
<li>Multiple language - I speak mainly french and I would like to post things in french as well as english. I also used to speak spanish, but I didn’t pratice it in 10 years, it could be a nice (re-)learning experience to translate my posts in spanish.</li>
</ul>
